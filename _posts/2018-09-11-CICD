#Continous Integration / Continous Deployment

CI/CD describes the way modern cloud based agile software development teams get code into production.

Continous Integration, is the continous integration of code into one code base made possible by GIT/GitHub.  
All developers can have the latest version of production code, and integrate their changes into the production branch at any time.

Continous deployment is the ability to move a built application into your production environment with each push of production code from the CI step.
This is made possible using automated deployment scripts.

Not all products will want code to go straight into production, probably most wont.  I would say you get fast feedback from end users but
most companies will want to at least user acceptance test.

Another versions of CD is Continous delivery, where developers will continously push to another environment with produciton ready code,
but the code is released to production in stages, maybe once/twice a week, or fortnightly, whatever suits the product.  Usually there is a 
User Acceptance test environment where a subset of users or product manages/business folk can try new features before released into production.
