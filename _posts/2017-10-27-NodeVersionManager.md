<h1>NVM - Node version manager</h1>

https://github.com/creationix/nvm/blob/master/README.md

<p>Sometimes you need to use different versions of node to work on different project.  
Node version manager makes it easy to install different versions on your machine and switch between them.</p>

<h3>The most useful commands I use are:</h3>

<ul>
<li>nvm ls - lists all versions of node installed</li>
<li>nvm install node - installs the most recent version of node, can install specific versions</li>
<li>nvm uninstall 0.10 - uninstall a specific version</li>
<li>nvm which 8.0 - gives the path to where the executable is installed</li>
<li>nvm use 8.0 - switch to use node version 8.0</li>
</ul>
