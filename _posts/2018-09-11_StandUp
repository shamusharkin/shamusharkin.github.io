#Daily Stand up

Daily standup is a practice that occurs in agile software delivery methodologies, such as Extreme Programming (XP) and Scrum.

The standup is supposed to signify the start of the working day, before anyone has touched a keyboard.
It is a standing up meeting (that is not a meeting), and is usually timeboxed to 15 minutes.  
The goal is to get the whole team delevopers and non-devs up to speed on a projects progress quickly.
Agile methodologies are story based, so each team member(s) working on a particular story will usually answer 3 questions about their work:

1. What did you work on yesterday?
2. What is the plan for today?
3. is there anything blocking your progress?

Thats it, in its simpliest form.

From experience, standups can be effective and ineffective.
Bad ones usually:

1. Dont start before work, but interrupt your work flow at some other point in the day
2. Not all team members are in attendance
3. Have long discussions
4. Team members do not answer the above 3 questions

I think a visual board with stories and names helps devs remember what their priorities are, 
sometimes if using tracking software its difficult in a bigger team to know what story other members are talking about
